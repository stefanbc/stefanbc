# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a seasoned senior software engineer at Ropardo, a prominent company based in Sibiu. My expertise lies in frontend development, which is where I mainly focus my work efforts.

In the past, I have contributed to various projects for SmartBill, spearheaded a community of over 1.5 million members, and developed exceptional products for Koding, a San Francisco-based company. Furthermore, I have built and helped with the development of presentation websites and online stores for small businesses at Sensmedia.

As a passionate advocate of the open-source movement, I am always on the lookout for fresh and innovative projects to work on. Currently, I am dedicated to constructing a local web community called [@SibiuWebMeetup](https://github.com/sibiuwebmeetup) in Sibiu.

If you need to contact me, please don't hesitate to drop me an email at [hello@stefancosma.xyz](mailto:hello@stefancosma.xyz) or look me up on most social media platforms using the handle @stefanbc.

On a personal note, I am an avid comics enthusiast and amateur photographer, and you can often find me indulging in these hobbies in my free time.

Please note that I usually respond to messages within 1-2 business days.
