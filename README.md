### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working for, Sibiu based, Ropardo, as a senior frontend developer. I previously worked for Romania based Smart Bill, where I helped in building their invoicing platform and San Francisco based, Koding Inc., where I helped develop their cloud development environment and developer community as a front-end developer and community lead.

I'm an active promoter of the open source movement, always developing new and exciting projects.

Currently I'm building a local web community, in Sibiu, the @SibiuWebMeetup.

PS. Also a comics enthusiast and amateur photographer (checkout my photos [here](https://unsplash.com/stefanbc)).
